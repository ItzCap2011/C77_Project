            <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a user-friendly code editor by Microsoft. It's lightweight, packed with features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and version control. You can customize it with extensions and themes to suit your needs. Perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.</p>
        <p>The console screen is a text-based interface where users can type commands to interact with a computer system. It's used for tasks like running programs, navigating directories, and managing files, without needing a graphical interface.</p>
